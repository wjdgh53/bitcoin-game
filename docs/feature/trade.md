Agent Detail Page Enhancement - Adding Trading History, Performance Metrics, and Prompt Visibility
Hello Claude, I'm working on enhancing the agent detail page in my platform with new features to display the agent's trading history, performance metrics, and the underlying prompts that drive its behavior. Please help me organize these requirements and suggest an implementation approach with testing methods.
New Feature Requirements:

Trading History Display

Comprehensive transaction log for each agent
Display all trades with timestamp, symbol, action (buy/sell), quantity, price
Allow filtering by date range, symbol, trade type, and outcome
Sorting options by various parameters (date, profit/loss, size)
Pagination for handling large transaction histories
Visual indicators for profitable vs. unprofitable trades


Performance Metrics Dashboard

Key performance indicators prominently displayed
Total return (absolute and percentage)
Win rate and average holding period
Risk metrics (Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, volatility)
Performance charts (equity curve, monthly returns, drawdown periods)
Comparison with benchmarks or peer agents
Historical performance tracking and milestone highlights


Agent Prompt Visibility

Display the underlying prompts that define the agent's behavior
Organize prompts by categories (personality, strategy, analysis method)
Formatted display with syntax highlighting for readability
Version history showing how prompts have evolved
Explanation of how different prompt components influence behavior
Option to suggest prompt improvements (for authorized users)


UI/UX Considerations

Intuitive tabbed interface to switch between features
Interactive charts with zoom and hover details
Responsive design for all screen sizes
Consistent styling with the rest of the platform
Tooltips and help text to explain complex metrics
Export functionality for trading history and performance data



Data Structure Example:
Agent {
  // Existing agent properties
  // ...
  
  tradingHistory: [
    {
      id: string,
      symbol: string,
      action: "BUY" | "SELL",
      quantity: number,
      price: number,
      timestamp: timestamp,
      reasoning: string,
      strategyUsed: string,
      result: {
        profitLoss: number,
        percentReturn: number,
        holdingPeriod: number
      }
    },
    ...
  ],
  
  performance: {
    totalReturn: number,
    winRate: number,
    averageReturn: number,
    sharpeRatio: number,
    maxDrawdown: number,
    monthlyReturns: {
      [year-month]: number
    },
    // Additional metrics
  },
  
  prompts: [
    {
      id: string,
      category: string,
      content: string,
      version: number,
      createdAt: timestamp,
      updatedAt: timestamp,
      previousVersions: [
        {
          content: string,
          version: number,
          timestamp: timestamp
        }
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
User Experience Examples:

A user visits the agent detail page and switches to the "Trading History" tab to review recent transactions
The user filters trading history to see only profitable trades in a specific stock
The user examines performance metrics to evaluate the agent's risk-adjusted returns
The user reviews the agent's prompts to understand the reasoning behind its trading decisions
The user exports trading history data for further analysis in external tools

Please provide a detailed implementation approach for these features, including component structure, data handling, UI design considerations, and Playwright testing strategy. I'm particularly interested in creating an intuitive and informative display of complex trading data and prompts while maintaining excellent performance even with large datasets.
